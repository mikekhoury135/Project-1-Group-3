# What If Stocks and Crypto

## Purpose
Purpose of this project was the practice all the skills learned from week 1 to week 6 and coming together to form a team to develop an unique web application that is going to be presented to our peers and teaching staff.

## Instructions
* When the user navigates to What if Stocks and Crypto website, they are presented with a button to add either stocks or crypto to be viewed.
* When the user clicks the button to add stocks or crypto, a modal window opens and requests user to choose either stocks or crypto.
* After selecting one of the options, the user can then type a stock or crypto that they wish to view.
* Then they select a past date from the calendar that opens up when the user clicks the date input field. They cannot choose future dates.
* When they user clicks "submit", they are shown the current price of the stock/crypto, current date, past price, and the past date.
* In addition, the search was added to the search history below the details and can be viewed again after other searches when clicked.
* The search history is saved to local storage.
